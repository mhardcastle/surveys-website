The deepest LOFAR image ever made, in the region of sky known as
‘Elais-N1’, which is one of the three fields studied as part of this
deep radio survey. The image arises from a single LOFAR pointing
observed repeatedly for a total of 164 hours. Over 80,000 radio
sources are detected; this includes some spectacular large-scale
emission arising from massive black holes, but most sources are
distant galaxies like the Milky Way, forming their stars (see insets).
