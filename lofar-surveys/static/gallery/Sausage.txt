The merging galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301. The cluster is
well-known for its giant radio source, dubbed the 'Sausage', in the
North. Multiple radio sources including extended radio emission and
tailed radio galaxies are detected with LOFAR observations (in red;
Hoang et al. 2017). The cluster also hosts extremely hot gas in the
cluster centre, seen with Chandra X-ray observations (in white; Ogrean
et al. 2014). Image credits: Duy Hoang/LOFAR Surveys Team
