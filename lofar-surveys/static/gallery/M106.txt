The nearby spiral galaxy M106 seen in an optical image, with LOFAR
radio emission overlaid. The bright radio structures in the centre of
the galaxy are not actually true spiral arms, but are believed to be
the result of activity from the galaxy's central supermassive black
hole. Credit: Cyril Tasse and the LOFAR surveys team.
