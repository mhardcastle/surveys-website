<h3>Catalogue description</h3>

<p>This is the current catalogue of the LBCS project, which is searching for
long-baseline calibrators for LOFAR. This is done by snapshot observations
with 30 beams, for 3 minutes each. Fringe solutions are sought for the
international array with the phased superterp; a source is currently
classified as a "good" calibrator to a given station based on the dispersion
in short-period delay/phase solutions (this is the quantity which agrees best
with the goodness determined by eye in a subset of the data).</p>

<p>If you use the data, please reference the paper: Jackson et al.2016,AA 595,86</p>

<p>Format of the catalogue:</p>
  
<ol type='1'>
  <li>Observation number</li>
<li> RA of the pointing (in most cases determined from the WENSS catalogue,
 from which the sources are mainly selected)</li>
<li> Dec of the pointing</li>
<li>Observation date</li>
<li>Observation time</li>
<li> Goodness of the calibrator on the international stations:
<pre>
 DE601 Effelsberg
 DE602 Unterweilenbach
 DE603 Tautenberg
 DE604 Potsdam
 DE605 Juelich
 FR606 Nancay
 SE607 Onsala
 UK608 Chilbolton
 DE609 Norderstedt
 PL610 Borowiec
 PL611 Lazy
 PL612 Baldy
 IE613 Birr
 </pre>
 where "P" means a clear detection of fringes, "S" a marginal detection,
 "X" no detection, and "-" problems with the antenna. This is judged by
 signal-to-noise ratio of the fringe fit.</li>
<li> Observation flags:
 O = no obvious problems
 A = bad amplitudes on one or more stations (may affect column 8)
 X = misshapen data (only one polarization, too few channels)
 Z = large quantities of missing data</li>
<li> Goodness of the calibrator on the international stations, judged by
 signal-to-noise of the Fourier transform of the data itself, from 0 to 9.
 There are some cases where S:N is OK but the fringe-fit fails - these are under investigation.</li>
<li> Quality of the observation, judged by the percentage of source detections
 on the shorter baselines. Above 20 is probably fine, below 10 is almost
 certainly a bad observation.</li>
<li>Separation from the reference direction</li>
</ol>

<p>In general: if a source is detected by a given station, it is almost
 certainly OK as a calibrator to that station if a source is not
 detected in a "good" observation it is probably not OK, but this is
 not guaranteed if a source is not detected in a "dodgy" or poor
 observations it may or may not be OK. We are working on these cases.
 Many sources are OK on short baselines (601,605,609) but not on
 others indicating they are resolved: if in doubt you may want to look
 at the PNG file of the observation (which shows the Fourier transform
 of the data) and the composite fringe-rate and delay map of the
 field.</p>

<p>Each row ends with links to plots of the data (PL,PR), a pickle of the derived results,
 a reduction logfile and a fringe rate/delay plot: see Jackson et al. 2016 for explanations.
