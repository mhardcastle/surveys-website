  <p>This page provides public access to the first data release of the LoTSS Deep Fields. These are deep LOFAR pointings in three well-studied extragalactic fields: Elais-N1 (16:11:00 +55:00:00), Lockman Hole (10:47:00 +58:05:00), and Bo&ouml;tes (14:32:00 +34:30:00). Each pointing covers around 20 square degrees, reaching rms depths in the central regions of about 19, 25 and 36 &mu;Jy/bm, respectively. The data release also includes multi-wavelength data over the central sky areas, together with source-associated and cross-matched catalogues over the central ~10 square degree region of each field with the highest quality multi-wavelength data. The radio datasets for Bootes and Lockman are described by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2020arXiv201108328T/abstract">Tasse et al. (2021)</a> and Elais-N1 is described by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2020arXiv201108211S/abstract">Sabater et al. (2021)</a>. The multi-wavelength data, source association and cross-matching are described by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2020arXiv201108201K/abstract">Kondapally et al. (2021)</a>, with corresponding photometric redshifts described by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2020arXiv201108204D/abstract">Duncan et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

facilities in several countries, which are owned by various parties (each with their own funding
sources), and which are collectively operated by the ILT foundation under a joint scientific
policy. The efforts of the LSKSP have benefited from funding from the European Research
Council, NOVA, NWO, CNRS-INSU, the SURF Co-operative, the UK Science and Technology
