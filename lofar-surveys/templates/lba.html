  <p>This page provides preliminary KSP access to the LBA survey of HETDEX, as a single mosaic over the HETDEX field and associated catalogue. 18,795 sources are detected and the rms noise level is around 5 mJy/beam at a resolution of 45 arcsec and an effective frequency of 55 MHz. The flux scale appears to be good based on a comparison with VLSS.</p>
  <p>If using the images and catalogues for science please be aware:
    <ul>
      <li>This is a preliminary reduction and you should check back here for updates before publishing anything based on these data.</li>
      <li>Further sky area may be added at a later date.</li>
      <li>All science use of the catalogues or images must be approved on the dedicated LBA survey page on the Wiki</li>
