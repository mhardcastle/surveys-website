<p>LOFAR's design makes it a uniquely good survey instrument. The
  individual dipoles are sensitive to most of the visible sky; the
  dipole arrays have a field of view of hundreds of square degrees at
  the lowest frequencies accessible to LOFAR.</p>

<p>LOFAR has carried out, or is in the process of carrying out, a
  number of sky surveys:</p>
<h3>MSSS</h3>
<p>The LOFAR Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) was the first
wide-area northern-sky survey to be carried out with LOFAR. Its first
data release is described
  by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...582A.123H">Heald
    et al. (2015)</a>. It surveyed the whole northern sky to a depth
  of around 10 mJy/beam with a resolution of 2 arcmin.</p>
<h3>LOTSS wide area</h3>
<p>The ongoing LOFAR HBA 120-168MHz Tier-1 survey is referred to as
    the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and is described
    by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...598A.104S">Shimwell
    et al. (2017)</a>. It aims to survey the whole northern sky at the
    full resolution of Dutch LOFAR (6 arcseconds) and a
    declination-dependent sensitivity which will typically be around
    100 &mu;Jy/beam. This is a factor 10 more sensitive than the
    current best high-resolution sky
    survey, <a href="http://sundog.stsci.edu/">FIRST</a>, and will
    detect over 10 million radio sources, mostly star-forming galaxies
    but with a large proportion of active galactic nuclei. A stretch
    goal is to image large areas with the resolution of the
    International LOFAR Telescope, around 0.5 arcsec, which will give
    a combination of resolution and sensitivity that will be
    unsurpassed well into
    the <a href="https://www.skatelescope.org/">SKA</a> era. Data from
    the parts of the wide-area survey that have currently been made
    public are available to download through the
    <a href="releases.html">data releases</a> age of this site.</p>
  
<h3>LoTSS deep fields</h3>
<p>LoTSS will observe a number of famous fields (Bo&ouml;tes, Lockman Hole,
  ELAIS-N1) in the northern
  hemisphere with the same frequency coverage as for the all-sky
  survey but with much higher sensitivity, potentially down to 10
  &mu;Jy/beam for the deepest fields. It will allow the study of star
  formation and AGN activity out to high redshifts, when combined
  with the excellent optical data for these fields.</p>

<h3>LoL-ss</h3>
<p>
LOFAR is currently the only instrument capable of deep,
high-resolution imaging at frequencies below 100 MHz. Even into the
SKA era, this capability will remain unique to LOFAR. With the LOFAR
LBA Sky Survey (LoL-ss) we plan to cover the entire northern sky in
the frequency range 40-70 MHz. We aim to achieve a resolution of 15
arcsec at an average rms noise of 1 mJy/beam. LoL-ss will be a
revolutionary tool to discover new ultra-steep spectrum sources (from
high redshift radio galaxies, to dying radio emitting plasma, to
radio-emitting exoplanets). Currently we have observed around 350
square degrees centered on the HETDEX field, and an initial data
release is planned for 2019.
</p>
<h3>WEAVE-LOFAR</h3>
<p>WEAVE-LOFAR is a spectroscopic survey of the LOTSS sky with the
  WEAVE fibre spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope. It will
  provide redshifts for the wide and deep tiers of LOTSS. More
  information can be found on
  the <a href="https://ingconfluence.ing.iac.es:8444/confluence//display/WEAV/WEAVE-LOFAR">project webpages</a>.</p>
